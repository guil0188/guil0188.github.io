        <h2> About me</h2>
        <article>
           <p> Hello, my name is Loic Guillen, I am 21 years of age, and I was born in Ottawa, Canada. My mom is Venezuelan, and my dad is French, so I grew up speaking three languages. French with my dad and friends, and school, English with friends and shows/movies. Unfortunately, I only ever spoke Spanish with my mom, as she is the only one in her family who moved to Canada. Therefore, my Spanish is not exactly up to par with my French and English, but I do practice as much as I can.

           <p>I attended Louis-Riel High School and graduated in 2022. I started a business program at Algonquin College that I didn't enjoy, and I ended up dropping out after the first semester. In September 2023, I began another program at Algonquin College, this time in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I also ended up dropping that program after the first semester, as it truly wasn't for me. In between then and now, I worked and spent 4 months in Barcelona in early 2025. I chose to go with this program because I have always been interested in learning software in Adobe and how to create a cool website, and I am positive that I will stick with this program.</p>
