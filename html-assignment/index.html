        <article>
           <p> Hello, my name is Loic Guillen, I have 21 years of age and I was born in Ottawa Canada. My mom is Venezuelan and my dad is French so I grew up speaking three languages. French with my dad and friends and school, english with friends and shows/movies. Unfurtunatly I only ever spoke spanish with my mom as she is the only one in her family that moved to canada. Therefore my Spanish is not exactly up to par with my French and English but I do practice as much as I can. </p>
