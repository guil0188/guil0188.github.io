            Hello, my name is Loic Guillen, I am 21 years of age and my birthday
            is February 28<sup>th</sup>. I was born in Ottawa, Canada. My mom is
            Venezuelan, and my dad is French, so I grew up speaking three
            languages. French with my dad and friends, and school, English with
            friends and shows/movies. Unfortunately, I only ever spoke Spanish
            with my mom, as she is the only one in her family who moved to
            Canada. Therefore, my Spanish is not exactly up to par with my
            French and English, but I do practice as much as I can.
          </p>

          <p class="p2">
            I attended Louis-Riel High School and graduated in 2022. I started a
            business program for the 1<sup>st</sup> time at Algonquin College
            that I did <em>NOT</em> enjoy, and I ended up dropping out after the
            1<sup>st</sup> semester. In September 2023, I began a 2<sup>nd</sup>
            program at Algonquin College, this time in
            <abbr title="Computer Engineering Technology - Computing Science"
              >CET-CS</abbr
            >. I also ended up dropping that program after the 1<sup>st</sup>
            semester, as it truly wasn't for me. In between then and now, I
            worked and spent 4 months in Barcelona in early 2025. I chose to go
            with
            <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> because I have
            always been interested in learning software in Adobe and how to
            create a cool website, and I am <strong>positive</strong> that I
            will stick with this program.
